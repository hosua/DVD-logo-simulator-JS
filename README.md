# DVD-logo-simulator-JS
DVD Logo simulator written in JavaScript

Note: The logo tends to disappear at the start sometimes, and I currently don't know how to fix it.

For security reasons, if you are running this locally you will have to host the html via Python or however else you prefer. It will not work properly if running the file directly in the browser.

This is basically just the web-based version of my other ![DVD-logo-simulator](https://github.com/hosua/DVD-logo-simulator) that I wrote in C++.
